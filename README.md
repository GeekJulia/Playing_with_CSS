🎨 CSS Playground: Cool UI Snippets & Practice
Welcome to my CSS Playground — a curated collection of stylish UI elements and visual effects built with pure CSS.

This repository serves two main purposes:
🧩 Showcase: A growing library of eye-catching UI components — buttons, shadows, hover effects, cards, loaders, and more — inspired by designs from around the web.
🛠️ Practice: A space where I experiment with and improve my CSS skills through creative and hands-on examples.

Whether you're looking for inspiration or just want to see what CSS can do, feel free to explore the code and try things out!
